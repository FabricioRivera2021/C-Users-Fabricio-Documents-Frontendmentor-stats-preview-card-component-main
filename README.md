## My process

This challenge took me more time than the others, for various reasons, i have to learn how to change the color of the img. I also implemented css grid for this work, it help a lot to practice it.
First i made the mobile version, next to that the desktop version, and then i add an extra media query for when the view on the desktop is smaller but not mobile yet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What i learned most was css grid, along side with the background-img properties,
it also help me practice the media queries, and the properties of width of the hole page as well as the elements.

### Continued development

It was really fun to make this proyect, i will continue developing my skills on the desing layouts.
